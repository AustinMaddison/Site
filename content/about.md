# Hello, <s>World</s> There!

I'm Austin, an undergrad in computer science at Mahidol University. My focus is in computer graphics and technical art.

---
On this site, I discuss **graphics and shader programming, technical art**, and whatever else interests me.

Other things that I like doing outside of computers and art is cooking, binging albums, horror games, a hike in nature and <span class="font-sans-thai tracking-tight">ชามะนาว</span>.
