I'm Austin. I'm programmer/artist navigating the intersection of technology and art.

Right now, I'm an undergrad in computer science at Mahidol University, with aspirations of pursuing a career in computer graphics.

This site is where I will share topics about graphics/shader programming, technical art and anything else interesting to me.

Beyond my interests in computers and art, I love cooking, binging one of my favorite albums, horror games, a hike in nature and lemon ice tea.
