Programmed custom rendering features using Unity shaderlab HLSL for an interactive installation in Bangkok Design Week 2024.


Additionally, was responsible for creating art, procedural animation and VFX assets for the interactive experiences.


Implemented depth sensor camera normalization for the onsite camera calibration tool. Intel realsense's API for Unity had the function definition for for this but ommited the implmentation entirely, very odd?!
