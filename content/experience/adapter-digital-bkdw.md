Programmed custom but simple rendering features using Unity shaderlab HLSL for an interactive installation in Bangkok Design Week 2024.

Additionally, was responsible for creating art, procedural animation and VFX assets for the interactive experiences.

Extended Intel Realsense's Unity API with depth sensor camera normalization for the onsite camera calibration tool.
