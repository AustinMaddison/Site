Programmed custom rendering features using Unity shaderlab HLSL for an interactive installation in Bangkok Design Week 2024.

Additionally, was responsible for creating art, procedural animation and VFX assets for the interactive experiences.

Implemented depth sensor camera normalization for the onsite camera calibration tool.

A little off topic but Intel's realsense API for Unity had a function definition for such a feature of normalization but ommited the implmentation, this was a very odd discovery.
