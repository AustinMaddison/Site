# About Me
I am a programmer/designer navigating the intersection of technology and art. Right now, I'm an undergrad in computer science at Mahidol University, with aspirations to pivot and pursue a career in computer graphics. 

I'm particularly interested in proprietary tool and shader development for real-time and offline productions.

Other things that I like doing outside of computers and art is cooking, binging albums, horror games, a hike in nature and sipping on ice cold <span class="font-sans-thai font-normal tracking-tight">ชามะนาว</span>.

Growing up in South Africa I always had these interests clash, I was drawn to the arts but I was also drawn to the maths and sciences. I was fascinated to know how things were made, I always watched the extras on all the DVDs I had at home and binged the hell out of How Its Made on the Discovery channel. I loved creation and how math and sciences were the means of doing that. However there was this notion growing up that these interests were to be separate. Attempting of having a deep interest in both were seen as counterproductive or unrealistic. Yet to me it always made sense that having a deep interest in both the arts and STEM could coexist and even intersect each other in interesting ways.
