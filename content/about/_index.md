# About Me
I am a programmer/artist navigating the intersection of technology and art. In production, I tend to wear multiple hats solving artistic and technical challenges. Right now, I'm an undergrad in computer science at Mahidol University, with aspirations of pursuing a career in computer graphics. 

Particularly interested in proprietary tool and shader development for real-time productions.

Other things that I like doing outside of computers and art is cooking, binging albums, horror games, a hike in nature and sipping on ice cold <span class="font-sans-thai font-normal tracking-tight">ชามะนาว</span>.

## FAQ
### What is your favourite show?
**Severance**. The score, story, cinematography and performances are oustanding. You have to see it to believe it. Just thinking about it gives me goosebumps.

### How was this site made?
I use a static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), it runs using the go programming language. It's templatinng and content management features are powerful, flexible and blazingly fast.
