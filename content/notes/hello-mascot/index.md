# Introduction
This project began last year in my first internship at Adapter Digital. They are a digital agency based in Bangkok. How I landed the internship is actaully a funny story.  

## The Interview
 Initially a recruiter approached me with a senior motion graphics designer role, I asked if I could get an internship instead because I was a full-time student. When I was interviewed by the people running the creative/innovation lab they were suprised to learn that I was still in my first year of university because they really liked my work on behance. 

The interview was great. It was the first time I had a converstation with somebody who understood the craft as much as I did, and it felt amazing to connect with someone on that level. The interview was lengthy, and I believe we enjoyed every minute of it. That is how I got the internship.

## Moving to Bangkok
While my university dorm was in Nakhon Pathom, not far from Bangkok, my roots in Phuket made me accustomed to feeling isolated in my interests in computers, art, and technology. Discovering Bangkok's vibrant tech, engineering, and art scene was a revelation. Finally finding a community that shared some of my passions was an incredible feeling of connection.
