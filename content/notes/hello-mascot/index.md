# Introduction
This project began last year in my first internship at Adapter Digital. They are a digital agency based in Bangkok. How I alnded the internship is actaully a funny story.  

## The Interview
I was reached out by a recruiter because they wanted to see If I was interested in a senior motion graphics designer position. They saw my portfolio on behance and thought I would be a good fit. I was a full-time student at the time so I had to decline the offer and ask if they could offer me an internship? When I was interviewed by the people running the creative/innovation lab they were suprised to learm that I was still in my first year of university because they really liked my work. 

The interview was great. It was the first time I had a converstation with somebody who understood my craft as much as I did, and it felt amazing to connect with someone on that level. The interview was lengthy, and I believe we enjoyed every minute of it. They gladly offered me an internship position. 

## Moving to Bangkok
My dorm isn't in Bangkok, so I had to move. It was going to be the first time I live in Bangkok. I was stunned to discover how vibrant the culture was for technology, engineering and art especially compared to Phuket which is where I grew up.
