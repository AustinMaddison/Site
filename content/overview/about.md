I'm Austin. A programmer/artist navigating the intersection of technology and art. In production, I tend to wear multiple hats solving artistic and technical challenges. 

Right now, I'm an undergrad in computer science at Mahidol University, with aspirations of pursuing a career in the innovative space of computer graphics.

Particularly interested in proprietary tool and shader development for real-time productions.

Beyond my interests in computers and art, I love cooking, binging one of my favorite albums, horror games, a hike in nature and lemon ice tea.
